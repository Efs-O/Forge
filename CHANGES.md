# Forge — Recent Changes

## 0.12.28 — Worker orchestration and safe structured editing

- Added bounded one- or two-worker coding orchestration across configured local
  and explicitly enabled cloud models.
- Added exact read/write worker access contracts, workspace discovery budgets,
  cancellation, backend admission, typed activity status, and coordinator
  review of verified changes.
- Added `apply_line_edits`, a strict atomic multi-edit tool with exact stale-line
  checks, bounded ordered operations, checkpoint integration, and exact worker
  path enforcement.
- Added opt-in local-agent consultation, MCP per-tool permission enforcement,
  non-evicting backend holds, and cancellation propagation.
- Hardened first-run configuration, Add Model preservation, permission gates,
  mutation metadata, and Keep/Undo coverage.
- Expanded the automated suite to 289 tests across 40 test files.

## Session JSONL Logging (HalluMeter + HalluScribe integration)

### What changed

Two files were added or modified to make Forge write conversation sessions to disk,
so that HalluMeter and HalluScribe can read them.

#### New file: `src/sidebar/SessionLogger.ts`

Writes one JSONL file per conversation to `~/.forge/sessions/<session-id>.jsonl`.

Called from `SidebarProvider` after every turn completes (in the `finally` block of `handleSend`).

**File format — one JSON object per line:**

```jsonl
{"type":"session_start","session_id":"<uuid>","title":"Chat","model":"gemma4-e4b-it-ud-q4kxl","timestamp_ms":1747000000000}
{"role":"user","content":"user message text","timestamp_ms":1747000000001}
{"role":"assistant","content":"assistant response text","timestamp_ms":1747000000002,"model":"gemma4-e4b-it-ud-q4kxl"}
{"role":"assistant","content":null,"tool_calls":[{"name":"read_file","input":{"path":"src/main.ts"}}],"timestamp_ms":1747000000003,"model":"gemma4-e4b-it-ud-q4kxl"}
{"role":"assistant","content":"Done.","reasoning":"I checked the file first.","timestamp_ms":1747000000004,"model":"gemma4-e4b-it-ud-q4kxl"}
```

Rules:
- First line is always `session_start` (written once when the first turn completes)
- `system` role messages are skipped
- Tool call messages have `content: null` and a `tool_calls` array
- `reasoning` field is included when the model produced a thinking block
- Messages are appended incrementally — each flush only writes new turns since last flush
- File is never overwritten, only appended

#### Modified file: `src/sidebar/SidebarProvider.ts`

- Imported `SessionLogger`
- Added `sessionLoggers: Map<string, SessionLogger>` field to the class
- Added `flushSessionLog(convId)` private method
- Called `this.flushSessionLog(conv.id)` in the `finally` block of `handleSend`, alongside `persistSession()` and `postTokenBudget()`

#### Also modified: `src/sidebar/SidebarProvider.ts` (HalluMeter bridge)

`postTokenBudget()` also writes `~/.forge/hallumeter-bridge.json` on every token budget update:

```json
{"model":"gemma4-e4b-it-ud-q4kxl","used_tokens":12500,"max_tokens":98304,"timestamp_ms":1747000000000}
```

This is a single file, always overwritten. HalluMeter polls it every 5 seconds to show the live ring indicator.

Added imports at top of `SidebarProvider.ts`: `fs`, `os`, `path` from Node.js built-ins.
Added `writeForgeBridge()` standalone function before the class definition.

### What depends on this

| App | What it reads | Purpose |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| HalluMeter | `~/.forge/hallumeter-bridge.json` | Live context fill % for ring indicator |
| HalluScribe | `~/.forge/sessions/*.jsonl` | Nightly sweep → Gemma summarization → archive |

### Build note

After any change to `src/sidebar/SessionLogger.ts` or `src/sidebar/SidebarProvider.ts`,
rebuild and reinstall the `.vsix`:

```bash
npm run build
# then install the generated .vsix in VS Code
```
